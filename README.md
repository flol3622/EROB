EROB-model
======

**EROB** Event-based Residential Occupant Behaviour model created by Silke Verbruggen at the research group of Building Physics (Ghent University) to model occupant behaviour in the residential setting and for the implementation in dynamic modeling environments (e.g. Modelica).
The model is based on the StROBe-model as developed by Ruben Baetens (https://github.com/open-ideas/StROBe). 


**EROB** is created in Python 3.6, and uses freely available packages.

To simulate the occupant behaviour of one or more households you need to run the RUN.py file which you can find in the map Corpus.
In this file some input can be given or the values can be kept at default for a random simulation.

The model is explained in more detail in chapter 9 of the phd of Silke Verbruggen:'Window use habits as an example of habitual occupant behaviour in residential buildings'.
